Performs the downwards, unequipped attack from Symphony of the Night, though no need to worry about a "secret meteor hitbox" here. Hits in front and a little bit behind, a decent move to land with or to trade against weak projectiles.

Functionally the same as Richter's, just with shorter reach. It is much safer than Richter's as the majority of the sword is safe on shield, as well as a handful of moves combo into this attack. One of his most important tools for spacing and for finishing combos!

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Back Air</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\bair.png" alt="">
A quick swing with a shortsword. Hits pretty low to the ground, and combos into itself. Mostly used when retreating from opponents, to cross up on shield, or to potentially start a short combo. It has low damage output, but combined with Dark Metamorphosis, you can make the most of the healing mechanic by starting a combo with this move.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Air</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\upair.png" alt="">
Remember in Symphony of the Night whenever you did a midair jump, Alucard's cloak would turn into bat wings? Instead of going for the standard swordie upair, Alucard has a rather unique upair. His cloak turns into wings and they clap against each other, creating a strong hitbox. The beginning of the move has a wide horizontal reach that will send into the final hitbox. It's not particularly safe on shield, but this is a great combo ender for attacks that send upwards.

It's just the same as Richter's...the exact same! Well, this has a small quality of life patch, where grounded opponents will always get launched upwards.
