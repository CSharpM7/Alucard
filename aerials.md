Performs the downwards, unequipped attack from Symphony of the Night, though no need to worry about a "secret meteor hitbox" here. Hits in front and a little bit behind, a decent move to land with or to trade against weak projectiles.

Functionally the same as Richter's, just with shorter reach and less landing lag.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Back Air</h2>

A quick swing with a shortsword. Hits pretty low to the ground, and combos into itself, however this move doesn't have enough strength to KO.

Remember in Symphony of the Night whenever you did a midair jump, Alucard's cloak would turn into bat wings? Instead of going for the standard swordie upair, I thought it'd be nice to give Alucard a rather unique upair. His cloak turns into wings and they clap against each other, creating a very strong hitbox. This move is stronger at the top, and also has decent horizontal reach during the beginning.

It's just the same as Richter's...the exact same! Well, this has a small quality of life patch, where grounded opponents will always get launched upwards.
