</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\nspecial.png" alt="">
Alucard's standard attack from Castlevania III. This is a tall projectile that knocks foes away. Only one can be out at a given time. It currently carries over the Belmont Axe's quirk of going through the stage.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Side Special (Dark Dive)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\sspecial.png" alt="">
It's an unspoken rule that all vampires in fighting games must have a command grab, so here's Alucard's. This move takes inspiration from Dracula's Soul Steal move in Order of Ecclesia. Foes hit by this move are forcibly moved up, and Alucard then delivers are dark explosion, adding a sizeable amount to his Dark Metamorphosis meter. When Alucard's cloak is glowing read, he will enter Dark Metamorphosis after landing this move.

In training mode, you will receive full Dark Metamorphosis meter for landing this move.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Side Special X (Mist Dash)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\mistdash.png" alt="">
For modpacks that modify gameplay, Dark Dive currently isn't compatible. Instead, Alucard's side special becomes Mist Dash. This move works like an airdash, and can be cancelled with an aerial.

<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Special (Wing Rush)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\upspecial.png" alt="">
The all powerful transformation is Alucard's Up Special! Functionally it is a mix between Fox's Fire Fox and Ridley's Wing Blitz. During the transformation, opponents will receive damage for getting too close. When Alucard transforms into a bat, a powerful hitbox emerges! The move can go in any direction, though this move does not travel as far as Fox's does. You can slightly influence the direction that opponents are sent at based on the direction you are flying in.

<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Down Special (Holy Water)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\dspecial.png" alt="">
The must-have subweapon. Since Richter/Simon are remaining unchanged, Alucard's Holy Water has been given the unique properties that Richter's Holy Water has in Symphony of the Night. This is a single hit attack that pops opponents upward. This version moves foward slightly, which is great on flat surfaces, but not so much on slopes.
