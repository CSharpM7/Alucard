Dark Metamorphosis is a state where any sword attack Alucard lands will heal Alucard by a small percent. Missing these attacks will deplete the amount of time you have left in this state, however. Down tilt and Back air are very useful tools, as they can combo into other sword-based attacks for a guaranteed heal. Becareful about relying too much on your sword attacks, as missing several moves will have you exiting this state rather quickly. Alucard has access to some modifiers for his special attacks as well. They do cost Dark Metamorphosis time, but they can be extremely useful in mixing up your game.

During Neutral Special, if you hold down the special attack button, this becomes Dark Inferno. Dark Inferno is a slow moving ball of destruction, that will explode on impact (including exploding on shields)! Dark Inferno will also explode after a set amount of time.
