	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Thunderbrand (FSmash Neutral Angle)</h4>
</div>

Thunderbrand is a powerful stab that creates a lightning bolt at the very tip. This bolt will paralyze opponents at the tip of the sword, which can lead directly into forward tilt at higher percents, can lead into forward air when reading an opponents' DI, or can even lead into up smash for a guaranteed kill at 160%...though why are you looking to land forward smash at that percent? The rest of the sword still does moderate damage and decent knockback, so don't feel pressured to hit the sweetspot. This is the most consistent version of the forward smash.

	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Icebrand (FSmash Angled Down)</h4>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash downwards gives you Icebrand, where the sword can freeze opponents. This is the weaker of the three angles, and the attack also sends at a more vertical angle, but this move will also hit below ledge. You might be able to catch foes before they grab the ledge with the sweetspot!

	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Firebrand (FSmash Angled Up)</h4>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash upwards gives you Firebrand. This explosive attack is the most damaging out of the three angles, and the sweetspot is also much larger. However, the main sword hitbox deals mediocre damage for a smash attack, and this will not hit short or crouching foes. This is a relatively high risk, high reward smash attack that works well against catching jumps.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Smash (Summon Familiar)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\upsmash.png" alt="">

Alucard summons the Sword Familiar upwards, similar to Bayonetta's UpSmash but with several key differences. The magic field the sword will spawn from will launch any foe standing on it upwards and directly to where the familiar will hit. The sword will last for a while, where the first few frames have a very potent launching hitbox, and the later frames have a weak hitbox that pokes opponents that land on it. Overall, this move will leave Alucard vulnerable from behind, but has great shield damage for the sword spawning hitbox. This smash attack is very niche, and you might not find great use for it in competitive play.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Down Smash (Summon Spirits)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\dsmash.png" alt="">

Based on the Tetraspirit attack from Judgement, this is a unique downsmash with two different properties. The first hitbox that hits grounded opponents will spike them! Combined with the low first active frame of this move, you can combo into aerials from this hit. On aerial opponents, it will send them upwards instead. There is also a secret spike hitbox on Alucard's hand for one frame! (V0.2) While playing HDR or ULT-S, you can jump cancel this move on hit!

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Final Smash</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\final.png" alt="">

Alucard summons a vortex that absorbs the souls of unfortunate foes, healing with each bit of soul you steal. The last hit will KO foes above 100%, and crumple anyone else! This Final Smash will miss if there are no vulnerable characters on screen, or within a decent range of Alucard, so make sure you time this move correctly.
