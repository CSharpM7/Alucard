	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Thunderbrand (FSmash Neutral Angle)</h4>
</div>

Forward smash is a powerful stab that creates a lightning bolt at the very tip. This bolt will paralyze opponents at the tip of the sword, which can lead directly into forward tilt at higher percents, or even up smash for a guaranteed kill at 160%...though why are you looking to land forward smash at that percent? The rest of the sword still does moderate damage and decent knockback, so don't feel pressured to hit the sweetspot. Unique to this angle, the sword hitbox lasts for a few more frames as electricity runs throughout the sword!

	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Icebrand (FSmash Angled Down)</h4>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash downwards gives you Icebrand, where the tip of the sword will freeze opponents. This is the weaker of the three angles, and the attack also sends at a more vertical angle, but this move will also hit below ledge. You might be able to catch foes before they grab the ledge with the sweetspot!

	<h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Firebrand (FSmash Angled Up)</h4>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash upwards gives you Firebrand. This explosive attack is the most damaging out of the three angles, and the sweetspot is also much larger. It's only main drawback is not being able to hit opponents close to the ground.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Smash (Summon Familiar)</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\upsmash.png" alt="">

Alucard summons the Sword Familiar upwards, similar to Bayonetta's UpSmash but with several key differences. The magic field the sword will spawn from will launch any foe standing on it upwards and directly to where the familiar will hit. The sword will last for a while, where the first few frames have a very potent launching hitbox, and the later frames have a weak hitbox that pokes opponents that land on it. Overall, this move will leave Alucard vulnerable from behind, but being able to stop projectiles in front of you, hit opponents on the ground, and being a potent kill option is well worth the risk.

Mostly unchanged from Richter, though the sweetspot is now larger.

Alucard summons a vortex that absorbs the souls of unfortunate foes, healing with each bit of soul you steal. The last hit will KO foes above 100%, and crumple anyone else! This Final Smash will miss if there are no vulnerable characters on screen, or within a decent range of Alucard, so make sure you time this move correctly.
