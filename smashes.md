</div>

Forward smash is a powerful stab that creates a lightning bolt at the very tip. This bolt will paralyze opponents at the tip of the sword, which can lead directly into forward tilt at higher percents, or even up smash for a guaranteed kill at 160%...though why are you looking to land forward smash at that percent? The rest of the sword still does moderate damage and decent knockback, so don't feel pressured to hit the sweetspot. Unique to this angle, the sword hitbox lasts for a few more frames as electricity runs throughout the sword!

	<h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Icebrand (FSmash Angled Down)</h3>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash downwards gives you Icebrand, where the tip of the sword will freeze opponents. This is the weaker of the three angles, and the attack also sends at a more vertical angle, but this move will also hit below ledge. You might be able to catch foes before they grab the ledge with the sweetspot!

	<h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Firebrand (FSmash Angled Up)</h3>
</div>

Angling Forward Smash upwards gives you Firebrand. This explosive attack is the most damaging out of the three angles, and the sweetspot is also much larger. It's only main drawback is not being able to hit opponents close to the ground.
