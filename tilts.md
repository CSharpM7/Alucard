Your standard issue forward tilt. Rather than being 1:1 recreation of the Symphony of the Night attack (with hitboxes similar to Richter), this move swings high to low so it can hit those pesky small characters, or hit opponents that missed a tech with a sliding ftilt.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Tilt</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\uptilt.png" alt="">
The Blue Knuckle uppercut from Symphony of the Night! It's fast, and it covers above Alucard. It's just a little lacking when it comes to reach, though. Combos into itself at low percent, and combos into up air later.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Down Tilt</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\downtilt.png" alt="">
A sweeping downtilt. The sweetspot sends players towards Alucard, and the normal spot sends them at a more vertical angle. It combos into neutral, back and up air at various percents, and uptilt at low percents.

Dashes forward and swings. Perhaps a better burst option than Richter's, this move has surprisingly long reach. This move does start later than Richter's.
