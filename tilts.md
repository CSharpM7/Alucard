Your standard issue forward tilt. Rather than being 1:1 recreation of the Symphony of the Night attack (with hitboxes similar to Richter), this move swings high to low so it can hit those pesky small characters, or hit opponents that missed a tech with a sliding ftilt.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Up Tilt</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\uptilt.png" alt="">
The Blue Knuckle uppercut from Symphony of the Night! It's fast, and it covers above Alucard. It's just a little lacking when it comes to reach, though. It sends outwards, dealing decent shield push. One might be able to combo into forward air at lower percents, but this is one of your few "get-off me" options.

	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Down Tilt</h2>
</div>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets\img\moveset\downtilt.png" alt="">
A sweeping downtilt. The sweetspot sends players more vertically than the rest of the sword. It combos into most of your airborne kit, and has decent shield safety. This is one of the most important moves in Alucard's kit.

Dashes forward and swings. Perhaps a better burst option than Richter's, this move has surprisingly long reach. It can be used to catch landings really well.
