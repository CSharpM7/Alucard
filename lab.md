This move is held together by scotch tape. There's a few issues regarding the part where the move grabs the opponent because this isn't coded like a traditional command grab.

Currently, this mod somewhat supports HDR and Ult-S being ran concurrently so long as you have their stage mods enabled (make sure you iron out any conflicts). Any common mechanic these mods have is mostly untested. With these mods, Dark Metamorphosis might not heal in the intended method due to function hooks, so it will heal based on the normal spot's damage regardless of if you hit the sweetspot or the sourspot.

Any other gameplay mod that messes around with how damage is handled could cause the game to crash on launch.
