    title: "Alucard Joins Smash!"
    text: "A moveset mod by C#"
    body: "The son of Dracula takes over Richter's spot as the new Castlevania rep! Alucard is a master swordsman who can use dark magic to overpower foes. His heirloom sword has phenomenal reach, but if an opponent gets too close, he won't think twice about throwing a quick punch. His special and smash attacks make use of his dark magic, delivering devastating blows. When you're on your Achilles' heel, use your command grab to enter Dark Metamorphosis and heal from each successful hit of your sword.<br/>
    
        
    As Alucard is a master of many skills, harnessing his true power might take a little more practice. Precision and reaction will be your greatest tools with Alucard, knowing where your opponent will be and making the most out of your combo starters will net you many victories. Mix up your strategy with his special attack projectiles, or his side special command grab. As a light fighter, Alucard can't take too many hits so be cautious of the moves you throw out."

    list:
      - title: "Is this a new fighter?"
        desc: "Technically no, Alucard is a COMPLETE replacement over Richter. This means everything from most of the moveset, to classic mode route, to tips, and even Palutena's Guidance (which is just her saying she has no data on Alucard) are replaced."

      - title: "Could this moveset be single-slotted?"
        desc: "Singleslotted means that this moveset will only work on one specific costume (ie Alucard is the eighth slot of Richter, and only that specific slot has the full Alucard moveset). There are several reasons why this will never be a planned feature, chief among them is the extreme amount of time that would have to go into remaking vanilla Richter, and making sure all changed parameters are hooked properly. Even though extra development time is being spent on alternate costumes, the goal of this moveset is to feel like Alucard was always in the original game."

      - title: "What happens to Richter?"
        desc: "Richter is being moved to Simon's alternate slots (similar to Bayo 1/Bayo 2, Olimar/Alpha, Ike/Ike), so the only difference will be Holy Water is now a fire-based move."

      - title: "Is this wifi safe?"
        desc: "All players must be using this mod to make this wifi safe. Obviously, do not play Alucard on quickplay, but you can play in Arenas as long as all parties have Alucard active, and are on the same version of Alucard as well."

      - title: "Is this compatible with other modpacks (ie HDR, Ultimate-S)"
        desc: "Yes, though this will not work out of the box. There might be Arcropolis conflicts with motion files, and there will be different fighter params (which control run speed, jump height and various other stats). I recommend making a copy of the modpack, but removing sound, model and motion files that are related to Richter. You might also want to edit the fighter_params.prcxml file found in fighter/common/param and remove entries that pertain to Richter, as well as remove the vl.prcxml file found in fighter/richter/param."

      - title: "Could I run tournaments with Alucard?"
        desc: "Uhhhhhhh ya sure. It's not like he's a new, uncontested top tier character. You probably want to get feedback from your local scene, and maybe not make it a PR sanctioned event. Oh and probably don't run a bracket with Alucard in it for a Nintendo sponsored event."
