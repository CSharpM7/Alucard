    title: "Alucard Joins Smash!"
    text: "A moveset mod by C#"
    body: "The son of Dracula takes over Richter's spot as the new Castlevania rep! Alucard is a master swordsman who can use dark magic to overpower foes. His heirloom sword has phenomenal reach, but if an opponent gets too close, he won't think twice about throwing a quick punch. His special and smash attacks make use of his dark magic, delivering devastating blows. When you're on your Achilles' heel, use your command grab to enter Dark Metamorphosis and heal from each successful hit of your sword.<br/><br/>
        
    As Alucard is a master of many skills, harnessing his true power might take a little more practice. Precision will be your greatest tool with Alucard, knowing where your opponent will be, and which direction they are will be launched in is paramount to netting victories. Mix up your strategy with his special attack projectiles, or his side special command grab. As a light fighter, Alucard can't take too many hits so be cautious of the moves you throw out. His options to escape disadvantageous positions are also more limited than other fighters.<br/><br/>
    
    You'll enjoy Alucard if you find characters like Ridley, Corrin, or Joker interesting. Instead of flashy, extravagant combos, Alucard is about making the most of the hits you make. Most of his kit will lead into forward or up air, but you'll have to know where your opponent will be to make the most of your combo starters. He's also got some extra pizzazz in his moveset for his specials and his smash attacks, so some of the Belmont classic setplay still seeps through his moveset. Once you understand your opponent, you can take the lead by entering Dark Metamorphosis and healing some of the damage you took before you lose your stock!<br/><br/>

    section: faq
    list:
      - title: "Is this a new fighter?"
        desc: "Technically no, Alucard is a COMPLETE replacement over Richter. This means everything from most of the moveset, to classic mode route, to tips, and even Palutena's Guidance (which is just her saying she has no data on Alucard) are replaced."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-user-plus

      - title: "What happens to Richter?"
        desc: "Through some clever magic (thank you CoolSonicKirby), Richter becomes a singe-slotted moveset over Simon. This lets Richter take the latter half of all of Simon's slots (c127-c255), which allows him to retain his taunts and his classic mode route. This has an unfortunate side effect of everything else being shared with Simon, including Palutena's guidance and Victory Poses, but it's a worthy sacrifice to keep him in."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-user-times

      - title: "Could this moveset be single-slotted?"
        desc: "Singleslotted means that this moveset will only work on one specific costume (ie Alucard is the ninth slot of Richter, and only that specific slot has the full Alucard moveset). There's no reason for Alucard to be single-slotted when Richter can be single-slotted instead."

      - title: "When will Alucard publicly release?"
        desc: "Alucard is scheduled to release to the public Summer 2023. He will be available as a free download"
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-hourglass-half

      - title: "Is this wifi safe?"
        desc: "All players must be using this mod on the exact same version to make this wifi safe. Obviously, do not play Alucard on Quickplay, but you can play in Arenas as long as all parties have Alucard active, and are on the same version of Alucard as well."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-wifi

      - title: "Does this work on emulator?"
        desc: "Sorry, I won't be able to properly test if this works on emulator. He is intended to work on a modified switch with a legally obtained copy of Super Smash Bros Ultimate."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-desktop

      - title: "Is this compatible with other modpacks and other movesets?"
        desc: "Yes, though this will not work out of the box. There might be Arcropolis conflicts with motion files, and there will be different fighter params (which control run speed, jump height and various other stats). I recommend making a copy of the modpack, but removing motion and param files that are related to Richter. There's no easy way to set all this up, but once you do, you'll be treated to some exclusive content like Alucard's phenomenal wavedash, or the Mist Dash special move!

        For other movesets, compatibility is mixed, as it's impossible to account for every theoretical moveset."

      - title: "Will Alucard join [modpack]"
        desc: "It's at the discretion of both the modpack developer and I whether Alucard should be a part of a modpack, so please do not harass the developers over incorporating Alucard."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-address-card

      - title: "What's Mist Dash?"
        desc: "Mist Dash is an alternate special attack that you can turn on in place of Dark Dive. Think of it like an air dash with the ability cancel it with an aerial! Dark Dive uses some tricky programming, which could behave poorly with modpacks or other movesets. If you want to enable it, simply turn on the Moveset X (Mist) mod instead of the original moveset. Alucard is mostly balanced around his Dark Dive special, so he might be a little less balanced when taking this move into consideration. "
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-cloud

      - title: "Could I run tournaments with Alucard?"
        desc: "Uhhhhhhh ya sure. It's not like he's a new, uncontested top tier character. You probably want to get feedback from your local scene, and maybe not make it a PR sanctioned event. Oh and probably don't run a bracket with Alucard in it for a Nintendo sponsored event."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-trophy

      - title: "Could I make recolors?"
        desc: "Sure...do note that there could be changes to Alucard's model made in the future. This won't happen for a while, and you will be notified if this process starts to take place."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-paint-brush

      - title: "Where's wolf form?"
        desc: "Why is this a commonly asked question? Not only are there not enough folders to make this work, not only would that require a new model, but I would have to rig and animate a quadrupedal character for one attack. Not to mention, there's no more available directories for me to use to create a new model. It's impossible, and I'm not willing to do this."
