    title: "Alucard Joins Smash!"
    text: "A moveset mod by C#"
    body: "The son of Dracula takes over Richter's spot as the new Castlevania rep! Alucard is a master swordsman who can use dark magic to overpower foes. His heirloom sword has phenomenal reach, but if an opponent gets too close, he won't think twice about throwing a quick punch. His special and smash attacks make use of his dark magic, delivering devastating blows. When you're on your Achilles' heel, use your command grab to enter Dark Metamorphosis and heal from each successful hit of your sword.<br/><br/>
        
    As Alucard is a master of many skills, harnessing his true power might take a little more practice. Precision and reaction will be your greatest tools with Alucard, knowing where your opponent will be and making the most out of your combo starters will net you many victories. Mix up your strategy with his special attack projectiles, or his side special command grab. As a light fighter, Alucard can't take too many hits so be cautious of the moves you throw out, and his options to escape disadvantageous positions are more limited than other fighters.<br/><br/>
    
    You'll enjoy Alucard if you find characters like Ridley, Lucina, or Palutena interesting. Instead of extravagant combos, Alucard is about making the most of the hits you make, breaking down your opponent's gameplan, and sealing a stock with a devastating attack or overwhelming pressure. He's also got some extra pizzazz in his moveset for his specials and his smash attacks, so some of the Belmont classic setplay seeps through his moveset.

    section: faq
    list:
      - title: "Is this a new fighter?"
        desc: "Technically no, Alucard is a COMPLETE replacement over Richter. This means everything from most of the moveset, to classic mode route, to tips, and even Palutena's Guidance (which is just her saying she has no data on Alucard) are replaced."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-user-plus

      - title: "Could this moveset be single-slotted?"
        desc: "Singleslotted means that this moveset will only work on one specific costume (ie Alucard is the eighth slot of Richter, and only that specific slot has the full Alucard moveset). There are several reasons why this will never be a planned feature, chief among them is the extreme amount of time that would have to go into remaking vanilla Richter, and that these types of movesets are incompatible with gameplay mods like HDR. Even though extra development time is being spent on alternate costumes, the goal of this moveset is to feel like Alucard was always in the original game."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-user-circle
        #id-badge

      - title: "What happens to Richter?"
        desc: "Richter is being moved to Simon's alternate slots (similar to Bayo 1/Bayo 2, Olimar/Alpha, Ike/Ike), so the only difference will be Holy Water is now a fire-based move."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-user-times

      - title: "When will Alucard publicly release?"
        desc: "Alucard is scheduled to release Winter 2023/2024, though this is a very strong estimate. While most of the moveset work is finished, there's still animations that need to be polished, models that need to be upgraded, and alternate costumes that need to be created. I am honored by your excited, but please be patient while I try to make this the quintessential moveset mod for Ultimate. Who knows, I might be able to release this earlier than Winter if things go smoothly."

      - title: "How does Early Access work?"
        desc: "Early Access is a way for players to help shape and mold the balancing and design of a product. There will be an Early Access tier on my ko-fi page to access this. You'll have access to this mod way before the public does, and have a voice on the balancing and design of this character. This also helps me work on the rest of the extra content (ie model improvements and alternate costumes) while early access players help test the core gameplay. You will receive access to all updates while subscribed, as well as access to **all** previous versions so you can continue to play with unsubscribed players.
        
        To start Early Access, head over to the Downloads link below, and select the Early Access tier."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-coffee
        
      - title: "How much will Alucard cost after Early Access?"
        desc: "Alucard will be 100% free once completed. However, with 7 additional costumes, various model optimizations, and whatever random complications arise, it could be awhile before Alucard is 100% completed. If you want to play him as soon as possible, my recommendation is to only do Early Access for a month and see how you like him!"
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-shopping-cart

      - title: "Is this wifi safe?"
        desc: "All players must be using this mod on the exact same version to make this wifi safe. Obviously, do not play Alucard on Quickplay, but you can play in Arenas as long as all parties have Alucard active, and are on the same version of Alucard as well."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-wifi

      - title: "Does this work on emulator?"
        desc: "Sorry, I won't be able to properly test with this works on emulator. If it works, great. If it doesn't, I won't be trying to make it compatible for it."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-desktop

      - title: "Is this compatible with other modpacks (ie HDR, Ultimate-S)"
        desc: "Yes, though this will not work out of the box. There might be Arcropolis conflicts with motion files, and there will be different fighter params (which control run speed, jump height and various other stats). I recommend making a copy of the modpack, but removing sound, model and motion files that are related to Richter. You might also want to edit the fighter_params.prcxml file found in fighter/common/param and remove entries that pertain to Richter, as well as remove the vl.prcxml file found in fighter/richter/param."

        #fa-database

      - title: "Will Alucard join [modpack]"
        desc: "It's at the discretion of both the modpack developer and I whether Alucard should be a part of a modpack. Most importantly, because Alucard replaces Richter, the playerbase of these modpacks must have a majority that will agree to replacing Richter with Alucard. That is to say, it's highly unlikely and please do not harass the developers over incorporating Alucard."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-address-card

      - title: "Is Dark Metamorphosis broken?"
        desc: "Wait why are you saying something is broken without trying it first? I would prefer to have custom UI but that's not something I can do, and that would make him incompatible with a few modpacks. Right now Dark Metamorphosis has an internal meter system, somewhat similar to Rebel's Gauge. This will still need avid playtesting to balance it out, but I honestly think it's a well-balanced mechanic."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-balance-scale

      - title: "Could I run tournaments with Alucard?"
        desc: "Uhhhhhhh ya sure. It's not like he's a new, uncontested top tier character. You probably want to get feedback from your local scene, and maybe not make it a PR sanctioned event. Oh and probably don't run a bracket with Alucard in it for a Nintendo sponsored event."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-trophy

      - title: "Could I make recolors?"
        desc: "At this current time, I do recommend not making any alternate costumes for Alucard as the model isn't finalized. I might change some of the UVs on his wings, or remodel his hands."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-paint-brush

      - title: "Where's mist form?"
        desc: "I definitely want to incorporate mist form, but the visual clarity of mist form makes it tough to put in. I would like a full unique move for mist, but it might have to go on some of his dodges. The primary focus on Alucard is to decrease the amount of confusion when fighting him, or playing as him, for the first few times, and this might be on the fence."
        icon: fas fa-solid fa-cloud

      - title: "Where's wolf form?"
        desc: "Why is this a commonly asked question? Not only are there not enough folders to make this work, not only would that require a new model, but I would have to rig and animate a quadrupedal character for one attack. Not to mention, there's no more available directories for me to use to create a new model. It's impossible, and I'm not willing to do this."
