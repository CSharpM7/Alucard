Here's some general house keeping about what to expect with the current state of the mod. Remember to check [the lab page](https://csharpm7.github.io/Alucard/lab) for known bugs.

Right now Alucard is in a VERY early state of things, you can kinda tell by his animations, swing bones and the fact that he's using Eight's shield right now. However, it is enough to get the general feel of what Alucard will end up like. Currently there are two alts for those who want to do a mirror match: his base alt, and his "World of Dark" alt that every fighter has. Sorry to those who want to play 4 player Alucard, but you can only have two Alucards present in one match.

</div>
EA members will be given access to the mod folder, simply place it in your `ultimate/mods` folder. You will also need to install:
- [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline) (you might already have this)
- [smashline](https://github.com/blu-dev/smashline_hook/releases) 
- [nro_hook](https://github.com/ultimate-research/nro-hook-plugin/releases)


Smashline and nro_hook go into `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins`, skyline goes into the folder with a bunch of numbers.
Your `ultimate/mods` folder should now have Alucard, Alucard Moveset, and Alucard Moveset X. For playing "vanilla" smash, you'll need to enable Alucard and Alucard Moveset. For playing a modpack such as HDR or Ult-S (these aren't entirely supported at the moment), you'll need to enable Alucard and Alucard Moveset X

Currently, this mod somewhat supports HDR and Ult-S being ran concurrently so long as you have their stage mods enabled (make sure you iron out any conflicts, I recommend making copies of the mod folders). Most notably at the moment: Dark Metamorphosis works slightly differently, which forces his Side Special to become Mist Dash (a toned-down, armored air-dash). Dark Metamorphosis will automatically activate once enough meter builds up, and meter is no longer gained/lost from receiving damage.
