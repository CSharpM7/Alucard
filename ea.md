Here's some general house keeping about what to expect with the current state of the mod. Remember to check [the lab page](https://csharpm7.github.io/Alucard/lab) for known bugs.

Right now Alucard is in a VERY early state of things, you can kinda tell by his animations, swing bones and the fact that he's using Eight's shield right now. However, it is enough to get the general feel of what Alucard will end up like. Currently there are two alts for those who want to do a mirror match: his base alt, and his "World of Dark" alt that every fighter has. Sorry to those who want to play 4 player Alucard, but you can only have two Alucards present in one match.

Currently, this mod somewhat supports HDR and Ult-S being ran concurrently so long as you have their stage mods enabled (make sure you iron out any conflicts, I recommend making copies of the mod folders). Most notably at the moment: Dark Metamorphosis is disabled for these mod packs due to issues with hooking functions.
