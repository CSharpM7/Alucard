Here's some general house keeping about what to expect with the current state of the mod. Remember to check [the lab page](https://csharpm7.github.io/Alucard/lab) for known bugs.

Right now Alucard is in a VERY early state of things, you can kinda tell by his animations, swing bones and the fact that he's using Eight's shield right now. However, it is enough to get the general feel of what Alucard will end up like.

</div>

EA members will be given access to the mod folder, simply unzip the folder and place it in your switch. It might ask to replace a few files, as `nro_hook`,`smashline`, and `param_hook` are bundled. The `.nro` files are located in `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins`. 

After you unzip, if you don't have `skyline`, you'll want to obtain it from [here](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline/releases) and place it in `atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/`

Your `ultimate/mods` folder should now have `alucard`, `alucard moveset`, and `alucard moveset x`. Boot up smash ultimate, and when prompted to enabled new mods, make sure you say no! Open arcropolis (eshop menu), and go to the mod manager. For playing "vanilla" smash, you'll need to enable `Alucard` and `Alucard Moveset`. For playing a modpack such as HDR or Ult-Sm or having any other moveset mod or plugin that could affect damage and collisions, you'll need to enable `Alucard` and `Alucard Moveset X` (or `Alucard Moveset Mist`). The modpacks HDR and UltS might also cause "conflicts" with similar files, which you will need to iron out yourself.

Alucard is compatible with the Training Mod Pack! Make sure you are using the "beta" or "pre-release" version of the TMP, found [here](https://github.com/jugeeya/UltimateTrainingModpack/releases/tag/beta).

</div>
Currently, this mod somewhat supports HDR and Ult-S being ran concurrently so long as you have their stage mods enabled (make sure you iron out any conflicts, I recommend making copies of the mod folders). Most notably at the moment: Dark Metamorphosis works slightly differently, which forces his Side Special to become Mist Dash (a toned-down, armored air-dash). Dark Metamorphosis will automatically activate once enough meter builds up.
